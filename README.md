# Sourdoughcalendar
## Intentions: 
Baking sour dough bread is a rather large time consume and requires quite a lot of planning and the timing must be on point. 
Therefore I have decided to create a program that when run, spits out a calendar file with several calendar events that represent all the different steps of the process. I would also like to be able to set restrictions like bedtime, so the program will tell me if starting the baking project is a bad idea. 

## Info: 
Language: Python


## The program needs to
### Base version:
* Find current time
* Contain seperate elements for each part of the process.
   * Name of step
   * Time task consumes
   * Time waiting before next step
 * Calculate what time it is at end of each step
 * Have two seperate options for proofing time: 
   * 12 Hour fridge proofing
   * 3-4 Hour warmish proofing
 * Be aware of bedtime
 * Give feedback on timing
   * Will process be done in time for either:
     * 3-4 Hour warm proofing and baking before bedtime
     * 12 Hour cold proofing and baking before bedtime
     * 12 Hour cold proofing during sleep
 ### Extended version: 
 * Create calendar events for each seperate step 
 * Export events to ical or similar format
 ### SuperExtended version: 
 * Create clendar feed
 * Check if events crash with other existing calendar events
